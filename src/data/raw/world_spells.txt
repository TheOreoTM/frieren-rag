## Spell Data

Section: Overview
Content:
Within Frieren: Beyond Journey's End, spells can constitute offense spells, defense spells, Goddess's
 magic, curses, support spells, or any other forms of magic, which fall
 broadly under "other spells." These classifications are fan-made and not
 from official sources with the exception of Goddess's magic and curses,
 and they are defined as follows:

Unofficial classifications:
Offense spells: Spells cast by mages in battle to attack opponents directly, potentially via modifying their surroundings to become ammunition or by conjuring up attacks with magic.
Defense spells: Spells with the purpose of providing defensive properties against other spells or attacks.
Support spells: Spells not directly used to attack but have been shown to prepare the caster for or assist the caster during combat, such as through incapacitating opponents, improving the caster's fighting ability/other stats, reshaping the terrain in an advantageous manner, etc.
Other spells: Any other magic or spell that doesn't fall under the other existing classifications, typically used outside of combat. This can consist of magic applied towards everyday life, such as spells that change the properties of an object or perform non-combat or trivial actions.

Official classifications:
Magic of humans: Magic utilized by humans and elves. Ordinary people, especially within the Empire, can use magic to a certain degree even if they are not mages. Some human magic is developed through extensive study and theorization of magical principles, and may need magic circles in order to be cast. The spells that humans discover are recorded in grimoires or on scrolls.
Folk magic: A general term for magic that has been passed down through the people. There are many such spells, ranging from ones that are useful in everyday life, to ones that don't have a clear reason for their use. Folk spells may originate from a specific region or tribe and often are specific in their usage and limitations.
Summoning: Not much is known about summoning, other than ingredients being needed for it.
Goddess's Magic: Magic utilized by priests with the assistance of Holy Scriptures. Those with a natural talent for the Goddess's magic are said to possess "the Blessing of the Goddess," also known as "the Goddess's Divine Grace," which makes them resistant to curses. In the anime, the Goddess's magic is usually depicted with a green glow.
Magic of Demons: Magic utilized by demons. Most demons devote themselves to researching one specific type of magic over the course of their lives, though demons are capable of using the magic of humans and may spend time researching human spells. Certain spells, such as flight magic, are so ubiquitous amongst demons that they are not considered to be magic at all.
Curses: Magic used by demons and monsters that changes the state of living or nonliving matter such as through sedation, petrification, or transformation. Their magical principles are not readily understood through the framework of the magic of humans. Curses are not perceived as magic by mages, and thus they are impossible to evade or obstruct using defense spells. Goddess's magic can be used in some cases to temporarily lift curses. To dispel ordinary curses a priest must utilize Goddess's magic, perform a ritual with specific equipment, or eliminate the source of the curse.

Both named spells and unnamed spells have been listed. Spells under unofficial classifications are classified based on the context of how they were used and thus may not necessarily be limited to a specific classification.
