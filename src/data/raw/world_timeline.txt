This article is a stub.You can help Frieren Wiki by expanding it. Please be sure to adhere to the Editor's Guidelines, Manual of Style, and Image Policy.

Besides the Mythical Era, the Unified Dynasty Era, the Unified Empire
Era, and the Era of Peace, all the era designations are fan-made and not
from official sources. They are defined as follows:
Era of The Great Mage Flamme: The time period marked by Flamme's life and the impact of her efforts.
Era of Humans: The time period predicted by Serie to arrive in a thousand years, marked by the birth of the Hero Himmel before the death of the Demon King
Most events in the Era of Peace are marked in reference to how long they occurred after Himmel’s death.
Events are listed chronologically. Events in red are not canonically ordered. The time range of the Unified Dynasty is not defined, so its placement between the Mythical Era and the Era of The Great Mage Flamme is not canonical. Events in blue are events that occurred in the Frieren: Beyond Journey's End Spin-Offs, but not in Frieren: Beyond Journey's End.
