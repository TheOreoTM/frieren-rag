Name: Aura the Guillotine
Description: Aura ascended to her seat among the Seven Sages of Destruction 500 years ago. She uses the spell Auserlese with her Scales of Obedience, which weighs the amount of mana of two souls and grants the party with more mana dominion over the other's body. The control of her magic is near absolute with the exceptions of extremely resilient souls. Because of this, Aura decapitates every body she controls, granting her the moniker of "Aura the Guillotine". Aura managed to survive a battle against the Hero Party. This battle depleted her of most of her undead army, and she was forced to go into hiding after the Demon King was defeated. However, when the Hero Himmel died, she resurfaced once again and began to wage war against Graf Granat's Domain. Aura was later defeated by Frieren after the latter tipped the Scales of Obedience with her larger mana pool.

Name: Böse the Immortal
Description: The Hero Party faced off against Böse on their journey to defeat the Demon King. During their battle, Böse trapped the party in his barrier, which Frieren considered indestructible and nearly accepted defeat. However, she managed to dispel the barrier within at least two months after encouragement from her companions. Frieren's ability to break through his barrier led to Böse focusing on her while fighting and underestimating the rest of the party, resulting in his death at the hands of Himmel. His subjugation became one of the adventure tales told about the Hero Party.

Name: Macht of the Golden Land
Description: Macht is considered to be the most powerful Sage of Destruction. He uses his spell to transmute all creation into gold, Diagoldze, a powerful curse which cannot be detected, analyzed or dispelled. The gold he creates with his magic is unmalleable and distinct from naturally occurring gold. In addition, he is a powerful physical fighter, who often preferred to fight with a sword. Macht uses the coat he wears on his left shoulder in battle, either transforming it into a large golden sword, or turning it into gold as a shield. He is also proficient at using other types of humanity's magic. Macht is one of the eleven mages that defeated Frieren in battle before, despite having less mana than her. He fought her six hundred years prior and turned her right arm to gold, which took a century for Frieren to restore. Unlike most of his fellow demons, Macht dislikes conflict, battles and expresses a desire to understand humanity's emotions, despite his repeated failure to attain the latter. His efforts to understand and attain human emotion led him to raze several villages and eventually led to his meeting with Solitär. At some point, Schlacht and Grausam showed up to recruit Macht for their battle against the Hero of the South. Macht would survive this battle, but his memories of it were wiped by Grausam. After the defeat of the Demon King and later Aura, he was the last surviving Sage of Destruction. Macht made a deal with Glück to allow the latter to live and attempt to teach him human emotions such as guilt and malice. He eventually turned the Fortified City of Weise to gold in an attempt to experience human emotions. Macht intended on escaping into the Empire but was confronted by Serie and her first-class mage apprentices, which included Lernen. Serie allowed her apprentices to seal Macht, along with the Fortified City of Weise, into the Great Barrier of the Golden Land.

Name: Grausam the Miraculous
Description: Grausam appeared alongside the other Sages of Destruction in order to fight the Hero of the South. He made an appearance when Frieren was reading Macht's memories, where his appearance was used to threaten Macht to comply with Schlacht's demand. Macht himself states that Grausam's magic is the worst match up for Macht. He has demonstrated the ability to erase memories. Grausam's magic is the Spell to guide to paradise: Ansehelschella, which puts the opponent to sleep and makes them experience an endless illusion of a happy dream, even if impossible. He casts Ansehelschella upon the Hero Party with the intention of seizing Frieren's memories of the future. Grausam's magic is especially effective to those that rely on mana detection. However, priests that are as strong and devout as Heiter are immune from his magic, implying that like Macht, Grausam's magic is considered a curse. Besides his mental magic, Grausam does not demonstrate proficiency in any offense magic. He is shown to fight using the swords generated by Solitär's spell. Upon getting injured by Himmel, he exhibits extreme fear and killing intent, which Solitär scolds him for. Despite the fact that the Hero Party was able to break his spell, Grausam was able to learn something from Frieren's memories of the future.
