Section: Overview
Content:
The Magic Special Forces is an organization consisting of the most powerful mages within the Empire. Imperial mages are trained in warfare and utilize magic specialized for military purposes, with members of the forces being mages officially acknowledged by the Empire. As a result, the forces act as national defense operators/agents that focus on handling uprisings or other incidents involving mages within the Empire. The unit is also tasked with defense missions, such as acting as bodyguards, monitoring gates, and guarding the Empire's borders. First-class mages have a disadvantage against members of the Magic Special Forces, as although the former might consist of the best mages across the continent, the latter's members specialize in warfare with magic.
