Section: Overview
Content:
The Continental Magic Association was established by the Great Mage Serie over fifty years prior to the present day, and it oversees the regulation and hierarchy of mages as well as their deployment on various missions. The association is also responsible for administering the mage class exams and doling out class certifications for mages based on the results of these exams.
Mages can be certified from ninth to first-class, with any mages below fifth-class being considered apprentice mages. Some first-class mages receive the opportunity to become Serie's apprentices, and besides being sent out on missions, they may also be asked to proctor mage exams. The Continental Magic Association may be affiliated with the education of mages through establishments such as the Academy of Magic.
