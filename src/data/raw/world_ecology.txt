Section: Environment
Content:
During the travels of the Hero Party and Frieren's Party, the adventurers traverse various landscapes with different kinds of organisms. Warmer global weather patterns shape the Central Lands and get colder towards the Northern Lands. There are differentiations between local climates in coastal regions, such as the area around the city of Warm, or regions of high altitude, such as the Schwer Mountains. A variety of ecological systems, including oceans, forests, alpine regions, underground cavities, and snowfields exist as a result.

Section: Biodiversity & Themes
Content:
The world of Frieren is believed by much of humanity to be brought into existence by the Goddess of Creation. However, ideas of evolutionary biology, such as convergent evolution, are discussed by various demons within the series. Species are depicted to form societies, such as humans, or small groups, such as animals that hunt together as a pack. Some species may also be solitary, such as demons, who live their lives minding only their individual needs and do not raise their young. Species will struggle for coexistence as they compete for limited resources and engage in predator-prey relationships.

Some lifeforms utilize mana, but mana can also be infused into nonliving matter, such as the Magic-Nullifying Crystals, and seems to be a property of the world itself. Some species can accumulate mana in their individual mana reserves, and they can train throughout their lives to increase these reserves. Other species fit in niches, such as the Stille birds, which are sensitive to sources of mana while simultaneously possessing very little mana themselves. Certain environmental substances, such as Holy Snow Crystals or ores, can be used in commodities like Magic potions and may be extracted by humanity for resources. Subsequently, both the exploitation and stewardship of the environment are explored throughout the series.

Section: Trivia
Content:
Frieren states that the Icicle Cherry Blossom may be her favorite winter flower.
The monster/dragon that chases the Hero Party in a flashback in both Chapter 1 and Chapter 34 resemble the same dragon, however, it is animated as two different creatures in Episode 1 and Episode 16 in the anime adaptation. It also appears in a flashback in Chapter 61.
Though the official Viz English translation calls the "Fresser" both a "lion-pig" and a "lion-bear," the second is likely a mistake and may have been intended to be "lion-boar" instead.
Wirbel first mentions that the Hero Party fought the "Hell Emperor Dragon" in Chapter 59. The Hero Party actually encounters this dragon in Chapter 113, though it is translated in this chapter as the "Abyssal Dragon" by Viz.
Various ecology have been options for voting during either the first or second popularity contest. The second popularity contest had two different rankings, one where multiple votes per character were counted, and one where only unique votes (one vote per character per person) were counted.
