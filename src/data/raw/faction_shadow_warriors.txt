Section: Overview
Content:
The Shadow Warriors is an organization composed of warriors who specialize in concealing their mana. They were originally established during the era of the Unified Empire in response to the growing number and prevalence of mages. It is one of the Empire's covert units, alongside the Court of the Sacred Staff and the publicly acknowledged Magic Special Forces, with its primary functions being to counter mages and prevent rebellions.
The unit is a clandestine organization, undertaking top-secret missions known only to a select few. Shadow Warriors swear loyalty to the Empire, with their primary task being assassination, as operatives carry out targeted killings from predetermined lists. They follow orders without question and are expected to lay down their lives for the cause. Additionally, they are told that they do not need to understand the motives behind their assignments. Desertion is treated as treason and punished by execution.
By order of the previous emperor the Shadow Warriors were disbanded sixteen years prior to the events of Serie's visit to the Foundation Festival.

This section is a stub on the Frieren Wiki.
Many Shadow Warriors are taken young from orphanages and trained from childhood how to fight. They weren't organized like a conventional military unit. Seemingly commanders on the ground were granted considerable authority. The use of force within the empire was allowed and they could choose their own targets for assassinations - "The List." A group of Shadow Warriors is led by a cell commander. In the past, there were multiple commanding officers. However, in the present, the only known leader is Commander Löwe, to whom various Shadow Warriors answer.

Section: Synopsis - History
Content:
Approximately twenty-one years after the defeat of the Demon King, the Empire fell into turmoil due to a succession crisis following the death of the late Emperor. Amidst the chaos, a Shadow Warrior officer dispatched a team of four operatives, including Radaal, to guard a mountain path in the Aufgabe Federation. They were explicitely ordered to eliminate all targets on a designated list, including Frieren and many others who had once contributed to the Empire.
Over time, various commanding officers of the Shadow Warriors lost their positions, resulting in many covert operations vanishing into thin air. Without formal orders to conclude their missions, some operatives, like Radaal, continued to carry them out for decades.
